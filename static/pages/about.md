About
====================

Hello, I'm Nate.
---------------------

**I love learning.** My thirst for knowledge cannot be quenched. For this reason, I am a firm believer in **open-source technology**. Sharing knowledge and information openly is, in my opinion, the best way to create a better tomorrow. This is the main reason why I have created this website.

By day I live as a professional **software engineer**. I have extensive **full-stack** development experience, with my current languages being **Javascript** and **C#**. I can also code in **F#**, **C++**, **Swift**, and **Java**.

By night I'm a creator of **cyber art**. Code musician, bass magician. Experimental [music production](https://www.soundcloud.com/vyjl), [IoT development](https://github.com/NateTheGreatt/led-controller), [generative art](https://github.com/NateTheGreatt/harmonoscope), and [game development](https://github.com/NateTheGreatt/Project-Utopia) are all hobbies of mine.

Even as a **graduate** I will forever consider myself a **student**. I regularly study **math** and **physics** in my spare time, which nourishes my psyche with creative inspiration. One day I hope that my technological skills can be utilized in the field of science, particularly physics.

This website was made with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), which uses my favorite front-end framework: [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).
