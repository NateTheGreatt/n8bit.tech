About
====================

Hello, I'm Nate.
---------------------

**I love learning.** My thirst for knowledge is unquenchable. For this reason, I am a firm believer in **open-source technology**. Sharing knowledge and information openly is, in my opinion, the best way to create a better tomorrow. I have created this website to add what knowledge I can to this open archive known as the internet.

Perhaps more than learning, I also love **problem solving**. Be it for work, or for play! Yes, I was that token nerd who won first-place in my high school's **chess** tournament.

By day I live as a professional **software engineer**. I have extensive **full-stack** development experience, with my current languages being **Javascript** and **C#**. I can also code in **F#**, **C++**, **Swift**, and **Java**.

By night I'm a creator of **cyber art**. Code musician, bass magician. Experimental [music production](https://www.soundcloud.com/vyjl), [IoT development](https://github.com/NateTheGreatt/led-controller), [generative art](https://github.com/NateTheGreatt/harmonoscope), and [game development](https://github.com/NateTheGreatt/Project-Utopia) are all hobbies of mine.

I love playing **video games**. The **Zelda** franchise will always be closest to my heart (I have a secret desire to remaster Ocarina of Time).

Even as a **graduate** I will forever consider myself a **student**. My major was **game development**, and my minor was **web & information systems**. However, I regularly study **math** and **physics** in my spare time, which nourishes my psyche with creative inspiration. One day I hope that my technological skills will be utilized in the field of science, particularly physics.

This website was created with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), which is built with my favorite front-end framework: [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).
