Hey there, welcome to my little corner of cyber space. Here I will be making posts about my personal projects as well as a plethora of topics, including but not limited to:
* Programming
* Cyber Art
* Science
* Math

I find this world to be a fascinating one, and I want to learn as much about it as I possibly can before my time here is up. Perhaps more than that, I'd like to share my experiences for others to learn from. As a strong supporter of open-source technology, I want to open-source my digital adventures. I've learned some neat things along the way, and I'm always leveraging what I've learned and applying them to my creative endeavors in cyber space.

Here's to the future!
